# Ball Control

This is a simple web application that controls the movement of balls on the screen. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Acess the link, set the number of the ball that you want to see on the screen and let a random algorithm control the show. 

I hope you enjoy.

Let me know in a comment.
